# Resource-Monitor
Work in progress personal project. Pulls system info from Arch Linux machine and dispays them on an Android device.

So far this only works on my Arch Linux personal computer. There are strings formatted in such a way that I don't expect it to work on any other given machine as of yet.

The server side code is written in C++ and currently retrieves CPU temperatures and sends them to an Android client.

Work in progress: using /proc/stat to calculate CPU usage by individual cores.

More features to be added as others are completed.
